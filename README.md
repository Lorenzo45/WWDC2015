#WWDC2015
This is my WWDC scholarship submission for WWDC 2015 that I was awarded a scholarship for. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out considering this was my first time using swift and built it in between my final exams.

The app mainly comprises of scroll views that have 3D transforms applied to them and their subviews to get some nice effects.
